# Beads - AI-Native Issue Tracking

Welcome to Beads! This repository uses **Beads** for issue tracking - a modern, AI-native tool designed to live directly in your codebase alongside your code.

## What is Beads?

Beads is issue tracking that lives in your repo, making it perfect for AI coding agents and developers who want their issues close to their code. No web UI required - everything works through the CLI and integrates seamlessly with git.

## Quick Start

### Essential Commands

```bash
# Create new issues
bd --no-daemon create --type task --priority P2 --title "Add user authentication" --description "What/why + acceptance criteria"

# View all issues
bd --no-daemon list

# View issue details
bd --no-daemon show <issue-id>

# Update issue status
bd --no-daemon update <issue-id> --status in_progress
bd --no-daemon close <issue-id>

# Sync with git remote
bd --no-daemon sync
```

### Working with Issues

Issues in Beads are:
- **Git-native**: Stored in `.beads/issues.jsonl` and synced like code
- **AI-friendly**: CLI-first design works perfectly with AI coding agents
- **Branch-aware**: Issues can follow your branch workflow
- **Always in sync**: Auto-syncs with your commits

Notes:
- Prefer `bd --no-daemon` for deterministic runs (and to avoid daemon/worktree edge cases).
- Valid statuses in this repo: `open`, `in_progress`, `blocked`, `closed`.
- Do not hand-edit `.beads/*` files; use the CLI so hashes and metadata stay consistent.
